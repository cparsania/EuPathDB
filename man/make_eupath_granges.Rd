make_eupath_granges(
  entry,

  eu_version = NULL,
  copy_s3 = FALSE

}
\arguments{
\item{entry}{Metadatum entry.}

\item{build_dir}{Place to put the resulting file(s).}

\item{eu_version}{Optionally request a specific version of the gff file.}

\item{copy_s3}{Copy the 2bit file into an s3 staging directory for copying to AnnotationHub?}
}
\description{
There is not too much else to say. This uses import.gff from rtracklayer.
I should probably steal my code from hpgltools to make this work for any
version of a gff file, but the eupathdb is good about keeping consistent on
this front.
