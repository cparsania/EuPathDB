\arguments{
\item{entry}{One row from the organism metadata.}

\item{build_dir}{Base directory for building the package.}

\item{eu_version}{Which version of the eupathdb to use for creating this package?}

\item{reinstall}{Overwrite an existing installed package?}

\item{install}{Install the resulting package?}

\item{copy_s3}{Copy the 2bit file into an s3 staging directory for copying to AnnotationHub?}

TxDb instance name.

\description{
This will hopefully create a txdb package and granges savefile for a single
species in the eupathdb.  This depends pretty much entirely on the successful
download of a gff file from the eupathdb.
