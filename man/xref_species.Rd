\usage{
xref_species(
  valid,
  invalid,
  verbose = FALSE,
  xref_column = "TaxonXref",
  taxon_column = "TaxonUnmodified",
  species_column = "GenusSpecies"

}
\arguments{
\item{valid}{Dataframe of entries which have thus far been deemed 'valid' by my tests.}

\item{invalid}{Dataframe of entries which failed.}

\item{verbose}{Print some information about what is found?}

\item{taxon_column}{metadata column with the taxonomy information.}

\item{species_column}{metadata column with my generated species name.}
}
\value{
Likely smaller data frame of valid information and larger dataframe of invalid.

\description{
Previously, the logic of this function resided in download_eupath_metadata(),
but I want to be able to test and poke at it separately to more effectively
ensure as many taxa as possible pass.  Therefore, I split it into its own
function. The secondary function of this is to set the 'Species' column as
appropriately as possible.
