\description{
When querying the eupathdb, it can be difficult to hit the desired species.
This is confounded by the fact that there are very similar named species
across different EupathDB projects.  Thus function seeks to make it a bit
easier to find the actual dataset desired.  If the specific species is not
found, look for a reasonable approximation. stop() if nothing is found.
