\description{
Every time I go to load the annotation data from an orgdb for a parasite, it
takes me an annoyingly long time to get the darn flags right.  As a result I
wrote this to shortcut that process.  Ideally, one should only need to pass
it a species name and get out a nice big table of annotation data.
