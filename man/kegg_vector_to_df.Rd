\title{Convert a potentially non-unique vector from kegg into a normalized data
frame.}
\usage{
kegg_vector_to_df(vector, final_colname = "first", flatten = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{vector}{Information from KEGGREST}

\item{final_colname}{Column name for the new information}

\item{flatten}{Flatten nested data?}
}
\value{
A normalized data frame of gene IDs to whatever.
}
\description{
This function seeks to reformat data from KEGGREST into something which is
rather easier to use.
}

This could probably benefit from a tidyr-ish revisitation.
