\title{Clean up the gene location field from eupathdb derived gene location data.}
\usage{
extract_gene_locations(annot_df, location_column = "annot_gene_location_text")
}
\arguments{
\item{annot_df}{Data frame resulting from load_orgdb_annotations()}

\item{location_column}{Name of the column to extract the start/end/length/etc from.}
}
\value{
Somewhat nicer data frame.
}
\description{
The eupathdb encodes its location data for genes in a somewhat peculiar
format: chromosome:start..end(strand), but I would prefer to have these
snippets of information as separate columns so that I can do things like
trivially perform rpkm().
