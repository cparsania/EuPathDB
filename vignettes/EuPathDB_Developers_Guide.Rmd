# Overview

This tutorial describes how to generate data ready for the AnnotationHubData.

It has not yet been written, but mostly is comprised of doing the following:

```{bash make_stuff, eval=FALSE}
## From the EuPathDB root directory
inst/scripts/make_data.R
## Note that this will take a few days, even if the webservers never fail.
make s3
```

Here are a few caveats:

1.  Get familiar with makeAnnotationHubMetadata().
2.  The most likely sticking point will be mismatches between GenomeInfoDB and
    the species IDs provided by the EuPathDB.


# Session Information

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
